## üìä Project Overview

This project tackles the handwritten digit classification problem using the popular MNIST dataset from Kaggle's Digit Recognizer competition. It employs three machine learning models ‚Äî Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost ‚Äî wrapped in pipelines to preprocess and classify digit images based on their pixel values. Automated evaluation and best-model selection are included.

## üîç Motivation

Digit recognition is a classic image classification challenge that serves as a benchmark for many machine learning techniques. This project explores different algorithmic approaches and demonstrates how pipelines and model evaluation can lead to robust and high-accuracy classifiers on this visual dataset.
