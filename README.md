## 📊 Project Overview

This project tackles the handwritten digit classification problem using the popular MNIST dataset from Kaggle's Digit Recognizer competition. It employs three machine learning models — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost — wrapped in pipelines to preprocess and classify digit images based on their pixel values. Automated evaluation and best-model selection are included.

---

## 🔍 Motivation

Digit recognition is a classic image classification challenge that serves as a benchmark for many machine learning techniques. This project explores different algorithmic approaches and demonstrates how pipelines and model evaluation can lead to robust and high-accuracy classifiers on this visual dataset.
